# RiseEnhanced

This mod is a compilation of other mods with some changes/enhancements mainly to suit the needs my friends and I have, don't know much about lua or reframework but I'll try to fix any bug that is reported.
I removed modules from my previous version since I don't belive I was really enhancing them, just copying the work done by others which is not good, the only reason I still do this for no hit stop is that I do want an easy way to disable when I want.

Current modules:

## Tweaks
- Disable hit stop
- Autosave delay (delay procs when returning to village)
- Smart reward multipliers (configurable thresholds)

## Item
- Auto restock (quest start, large monster kill and death)
- Auto items (with custom triggers and rebuff option)

## Dango
- Auto dango (quest start and death with custom set when carting)
- Increase dango skill chance to 100%

## Spirit Birds
- Spawn prism or custom ammount (quest start)

## Weakness Display
- Show monsters hit zone values on a floating window for current quest

## Cheats
- Unlimited coatings and ammo
