# RiseEnhanced

This mod is more of a compilation of other mods than a mod of it's own, I did make some changes to the code of the mods mainly to suit the needs I have or make them work as modules for this mod, don't know much about lua or reframework but I'll try to fix any bug that is reported

Current modules:

- Auto Cohoot Nest
- Auto Dango + Eat again button
- Auto NPC Talk (no bullshit mod)
- Auto Restock (without spamming restock for every loadout change)
- Nearest Camp Revive
- Spirit Birds QoL (start with custom spiritbirds)
- VIP Dango Ticket

All of this mods can be obtain on modnexus by the original developers, but the custom code on auto dango, auto restock and the spiribird qol cannot sadly, if you only care about the modifications, it's not that hard to just copy/paste them on the original mod since the logic is quite simple
